Ever since I was kid, I had no interest in learning anything about computers and its related technologies. I always used to wonder that how can people have interest in such a boring thing and they are ready to start their career in this field. The destiny of life, I ended up taking Computer Science just because it will assure me a successfull career ahead. I still remember the first day of my college where I was facing difficulty in writing a "Hello World" program. Anyways, first year of college was a mixture of subjects from many fields so I easily aced it without any difficulty. The turning point of my life was second year, where I faced the actual reality of dealing with all the computer techs and their concepts. I was a bit overwhelmed with everything and ended up scoring low in my exams. This is when I realised that you cannot survive in this field without creating interest in it and without updating yourself with the information about the tech world. 


Now the hard part was what to start with. I started doing my research and found out that I really get fascinated with the designs of the websites everytime I visit any. I wanted my imagination to come to life and Web Development is the place where I can achieve that. To be more precised, I was inclined towards the designing part of the websites. So I started with HTML and CSS and sticked to it for 6 months straight. It was one year back when I realised that I want to learn everything about the web, not for the sake of building my future, but because now it felt like an addiction and I felt the need to grow more in this field. Now I'm in my final year of bachelors and I can't deny the fact that there is so much more out there which is yet to be explored by me. So you cannot be sure about what you are doing right now, and what you'll be doing 5 years later from now.


So initially I started with learning the basics of HTML and CSS. Many people think that learning the basics of these languages is enough, but that's not the truth. To be really good at developing a website, you need to master both the things along with their strong fundamental concepts. I read many articles, blogs and took many courses for building the mindset and skills while building a website. After getting proficient in writing their codes. I jumped straight into learning JavaScript. It turned out to be interesting as well as overwhelming at the same time. You cannot master JavaScript in a month, it needs a huge investment of time and that's what I did. I took a JavaScript course from udemy and starting investing most of my time in it. This was the phase where I started telling myself that development is actually not that easy as I thought. Time passed by, I got better at everything and now I am in the place where I can build scalable applications without any help from others. Over the last few years I have worked on many technologies like React, Gatsby, Node, Sass, Tailwind CSS and etc. Just work hard towards your goal and don't think much about what you will get from it.
